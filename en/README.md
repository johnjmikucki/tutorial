## About This Book

This book is a prototype Django Girls course designed and formatted for classroom use.  In class, your coaches will explain/demonstrate a new concept and then give you time to apply it in your own small-group project.  We think it's a more engaging and interesting way to learn!  However, it isn't really suited for solo study.  So, if you don't have an instructor handy, the normal tutorial at http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/ may be more useful.

## Background

There's a lot of technology.  Sometimes it seems like magic, sometimes it seems overwhelmingly complex, and sometimes both at once!  But what one person can create, another can learn-- and today we're going to learn about programming.

Specifically, we're going to build a simple web site - what, exactly, is up to you! - and walk you through the concepts behind it.  As we go you'll learn the basics of Python and Django, get a taste for how fun they can be, and become more comfortable poking into the nooks and crannies of these (and other) technologies on your own. 

The tutorial will not magically turn you into a programmer.  Like any other skill, mastery can take months or even years of learning and practice. But we want to show you that programming or creating websites is not as complicated as they can seem, so you can go exploring with confidence. :)

We hope that we'll be able to make you love technology as much as we do!

## What will you learn during the tutorial?

Once you've finished the tutorial, you will have a simple, working web application: your own blog. We will show you how to put it online, so others will see your work!

We can't show you what yours will look like - after all, you get to choose what you'll build today - but here's what the demo will (more or less) look like:

## Would you like to help us translate the tutorial to other languages?

That's really awesome but we are still working on the English version.  Once we get it smoothed out we'd love to have help translating though!
