Makes it look pretty easy, doesn't it?  **Remember:** This version of the tutorial is a supplement for the lecture.  If you're extra puzzled and you don't have a coach around to answer your questions (for example, you're at home!) you can also check out the [original DjangoGirls tutorial](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/) which is great for working through on your own at home!
